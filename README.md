# Explications

# main.bat

The main.bat file was created to make GET requests and POST requests with the aim of modifying the main page of the Solyd Tecnologia laboratory http://www.bancocn.com so that an HTML of your choice can be placed

# post.py

The post.py file must be in the same folder as main.bat, it contains a POST request to the same site that modifies the site with hardcoded HTML

# Others

You'll need a shell to modify the site's home page.

I highly recommend using webadmin.php5.

It can be found at

I can't make all the files available because they contain things that if used for run things, I'll probably be the culprit.
